    Parameters
    ----------
    env_name : str
        Name of the environment from procgen to use. Should include the version tag.
        For example: "coinrun-v0".
    nb_tasks : int
        Number of tasks in the setting.
    num_levels_per_task : int, optional
        Number of generated levels per task, by default 1
    overlapping_levels_between_tasks : int, optional
        Number of levels in common between neighbouring tasks. Needs to be less than
        `num_levels_per_task`. Defaults to 0, in which case all tasks distinct levels.
    common_options : ProcGenConfig, optional
        Set of options common to the envs of all the tasks. This can be used to set the starting
        level, for example. Defaults to None, in which case the default options from `ProcGenConfig`
        are used.
    setting_type : Type[SettingType], optional
        The type of setting to create, by default TaskIncrementalRLSetting.

    For example, say `nb_tasks`=5, `num_levels_per_task`=2, `overlapping_levels_between_tasks`=1:

    task #1: levels: [0, 1]
    task #2: levels: [1, 2]
    task #3: levels: [2, 3]
    task #4: levels: [3, 4]
    task #5: levels: [4, 5]

    For example, say `nb_tasks`=5, `num_levels_per_task`=5, `overlapping_levels_between_tasks`=2:
    task #1: levels: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    task #2: levels: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    task #3: levels: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    task #4: levels: [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
    task #5: levels: [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]

    NOTE: (lebrice): Maybe this (and other benchmark-creating functions) could be classmethods on
    the settings, instead of passing the setting_type as a parameter!

    -------
    SettingType
        A Setting of type `setting_type` (`TaskIncrementalRLSetting`) by default, where each task
        uses environments from ProcGen.
