""" This module defines the `Setting` class, an ML "problem" to solve.

The `Setting` class is an abstract base class which should represent the most
general learning setting imaginable, i.e. with the fewest assumptions about the
data, the environment, the agent, etc.


The Setting class is currently loosely based on the `LightningDataModule` class
from pytorch-lightning, with the goal of having an `TraditionalSLSetting` node somewhere
in the tree, which would be totally interchangeable with existing datamodules
from pytorch-lightning.

The hope is that by staying close to that API, we can make it easier for people
to adopt the repo, and also, if possible, directly reuse existing models from
pytorch-lightning.

    """ Base class for all research settings in ML: Root node of the tree.

    A 'setting' is loosely defined here as a learning problem with a specific
    set of assumptions, restrictions, and an evaluation procedure.

    For example, Reinforcement Learning is a type of Setting in which we assume
    that an Agent is able to observe an environment, take actions upon it, and
    receive rewards back from the environment. Some of the assumptions include
    that the reward is dependant on the action taken, and that the actions have
    an impact on the environment's state (and on the next observations the agent
    will receive). The evaluation procedure consists in trying to maximize the
    reward obtained from an environment over a given number of steps.

    This 'Setting' class should ideally represent the most general learning
    problem imaginable, with almost no assumptions about the data or evaluation
    procedure.

    This is a dataclass. Its attributes are can also be used as command-line
    arguments using `simple_parsing`.

    Abstract (required) methods:
    - **apply** Applies a given Method on this setting to produce Results.
    - **prepare_data** (things to do on 1 GPU/TPU not on every GPU/TPU in distributed mode).
    - **setup**  (things to do on every accelerator in distributed mode).
    - **train_dataloader** the training environment/dataloader.
    - **val_dataloader** the val environments/dataloader(s).
    - **test_dataloader** the test environments/dataloader(s).

    "Abstract"-ish (required) class attributes:
    - `Results`: The class of Results that are created when applying a Method on
      this setting.
    - `Observations`: The type of Observations that will be produced  in this
        setting.
    - `Actions`: The type of Actions that are expected from this setting.
    - `Rewards`: The type of Rewards that this setting will (potentially) return
      upon receiving an action from the method.
