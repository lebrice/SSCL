    tree.

    Abstract (required) methods:
    - (new) **apply** Applies a given Method on this setting to produce Results.
    - **prepare_data** (things to do on 1 GPU/TPU not on every GPU/TPU in distributed mode).
    - **setup**  (things to do on every accelerator in distributed mode).
    - **train_dataloader** the training environment/dataloader.
    - **val_dataloader** the val environments/dataloader(s).
    - **test_dataloader** the test environments/dataloader(s).
    
    "Abstract"-ish (required) class attributes:
    - `Results`: The class of Results that are created when applying a Method on
      this setting.
    - `Observations`: The type of Observations that will be produced  in this
        setting.
    - `Actions`: The type of Actions that are expected from this setting.
    - `Rewards`: The type of Rewards that this setting will (potentially) return

        Defines the training/evaluation procedure specific to this Setting.
        
        The training/evaluation loop can be defined however you want, as long as
        it respects the following constraints:

        1.  This method should always return either a float or a Results object
            that indicates the "performance" of this method on this setting.

        2. More importantly: You **have** to make sure that you do not break
            compatibility with more general methods targetting a parent setting!
            It should always be the case that all methods designed for any of
            this Setting's parents should also be applicable via polymorphism,
            i.e., anything that is defined to work on the class `Animal` should
            also work on the class `Cat`!

        3. While not enforced, it is strongly encourged that you define your
            training/evaluation routines at a pretty high level, so that Methods
            that get applied to your Setting can make use of pytorch-lightning's
            `Trainer` & `LightningDataModule` API to be neat and fast.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        method : Method
            A Method to apply on this Setting.
        
        config : Optional[Config]
            Optional configuration object with things like the log dir, the data
            dir, cuda, wandb config, etc. When None, will be parsed from the
            current command-line arguments. 

        Returns
        -------
        Results
            An object that is used to measure or quantify the performance of the
            Method on this experimental Setting.
