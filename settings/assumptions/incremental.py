        Args:

            `IncrementalSetting.Results`:  An object that holds the test metrics
            and that is used to define the `objective` - a float representing
            how 'good' this method was on this given setting).
            This object is also useful for creating the plots, serialization,
            and logging to wandb. See `Results` for more info.

        Important Notes:
        -   The PL way of doing this here would be something like:
            `test_results = method.test(datamodule=self)`, however, there are
            some issues with doing it this way (as I just recently learned):
            - This gives the method/model access to the labels at test time;
            - The Method/LightningModule gets the responsibility of creating the
              metrics we're interested in measuring in its `test_step` method.
            - It might be difficult to customize the test loop. For example,
              How would one go about adding some kind of 'test-time training'
              or OSAKA-like evaluation setup using the usual
              `[train/val/test]_step` methods?

            However, I'd rather not do that, and write out the test loop
            manually here, which also allows us more flexibility, but also has
            some downsides:
            - We don't currently support any of the Callbacks from
              pytorch-lightning during testing.

            For some subclasses (e.g `IIDSetting`), it might be totally fine to
            just use the usual Trainer.fit() and Trainer.test() methods, so feel
            free to overwrite this method with your own implementation if that
            makes your life easier.
